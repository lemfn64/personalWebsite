description: Replace the Resume/CV PDFs while keeping stable filenames and links.

## What I do
I update downloadable Resume/CV assets without changing public URLs.

## When to use me
Use me when you have a new Resume or CV PDF to publish.

## How to use me
- Replace files in-place (keep the same names):
  - `public/s/Resume.pdf`
  - `public/s/CV.pdf`
- Verify via local server that the links open/download.
